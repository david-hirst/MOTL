# MOTL: multi-omics matrix factorization with tranfer learning

## MOTL code repository contents

This repository contains code used to recreate analyses described in the MOTL paper, as well as functions that can be downloaded to apply MOTL to a target dataset in order to perform matrix factorization with transfer learning.

The repository is organised into three folders:

[SimulationStudy](https://github.com/david-hirst/MOTL/tree/main/SimulationStudy): This folder contains scripts for carrying out the simulation study. More details in the [00_SimStudy_ReadMe.md](https://github.com/david-hirst/MOTL/blob/main/SimulationStudy/00_SimStudy_ReadMe.md) file

[TCGAStudy](https://github.com/david-hirst/MOTL/tree/main/TCGAStudy): This folder contains scripts for carrying out the TCGA study, as well as functions that can be downloaded to apply MOTL to a target dataset of interest.. More details in the [00_TCGAstudy_ReadMe.md](https://github.com/david-hirst/MOTL/blob/main/TCGAStudy/00_TCGAstudy_ReadMe.md) file.

[GlioblastomaUseCase](https://github.com/david-hirst/MOTL/tree/main/GlioblastomaUseCase): This folder contains scripts for the use case illustration of MOTL with glioblastoma data.
